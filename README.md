# Display-Vibe_Shield
PCB design incorporating OLED display and Vibe motor for either/or/and application

Brand new. I'm looking at the Jinlong Machinery & Electronics part number C1020B001D which appears to be able to be a 'mid mount' motor. 

This design is subject to change without notice but with version control.
